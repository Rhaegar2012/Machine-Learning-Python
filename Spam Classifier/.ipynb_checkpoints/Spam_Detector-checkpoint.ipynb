      "DataPower delivers XML acceleration device\n",
      "By Scott Tyler Shafer\n",
      "August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n",
      "\n",
      "DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \n",
      "specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \n",
      "process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \n",
      "hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \n",
      "according to company officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \n",
      "family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",
      "controls the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \n",
      "Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \n",

      "> \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \n",
      "> file size up \n",
      "> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "> alternative.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "> importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "> said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "> Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach \n",
      "> the company \n",
      "> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \n",
      "> regards to speed \n",
      "> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \n",
      "> he believes \n",
      "> will be mostly false.\n",
      "> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes \n",
      "> of a packet, \n",
      "> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \n",
      "> 1,400 bytes \n",
      "> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \n",
      "> collection of \n",
      "> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \n",
      "> markup language \n",
      "> as they pass through the device.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \n",
      "> will identify \n",
      "> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an \n",
      "> application \n",
      "> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators \n",
      "> more granular \n",
      "> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",

      "August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n",
      "\n",
      "DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \n",
      "specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \n",
      "process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \n",
      "hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \n",
      "according to company officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\n",
      "\n",
      "family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\n",
      "\n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\n",
      "\n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\n",
      "\n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\n",
      "\n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\n",
      "\n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\n",
      "\n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",
      "controls the device.\n",

      "At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as \"Little Chicago.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. \n",
      "\n",
      "But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,\" Jose Sandoval, author of \"Mother Aged 5,\" told Reuters. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,\" he added. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Totally willing to help'\n",
      "Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're totally willing to help her,\" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. \"She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,\" he said. \"She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medical rarity\n",
      "No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her swelling stomach worried her parents. \"They thought it was a tumor,\" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. \n",
      "\n",
      "There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. \n",
      "\n",
      "More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. \n",
      "\n",
      "One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. \n",
      "\n",
      "But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in \"moral danger,\" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Sandoval said: \"It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Happy ending?\n",
      "Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. \n",
      "\n",
      "After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. \n",
      "\n",
      "She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. \"We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,\" said Jurado, adding he thought \"absolutely nothing\" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said its value was \"more or less $25,000\" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. \"I believe there will be a happy ending,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era\n",
      "of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the\n",
      "country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\n",

      "calls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \n",

      "other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \n",

      "breakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \n",
      "commission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \n",
      "self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n",
      "ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n",
      "long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \n",
      "which customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \n",
      "company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \n",
      "mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n",
      "phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n",
      "to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \n",
      "everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \n",
      "millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \n",
      "telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \n",
      "monopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \n",
      "control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \n",
      "the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \n",
      "and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \n",
      "consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \n",
      "prosperous, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n",
      "one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \n",
      "most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \n",
      "Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \n",
      "modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \n",
      "bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \n",
      "as \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \n",
      "of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \n",
      "offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \n",
      "companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \n",
      "customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \n",
      "get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \n",
      "competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \n",
      "economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \n",
      "Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \n",
      "helping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \n",
      "brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \n",
      "jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \n",
      "beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \n",
      "slogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \n",
      "the twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \n",
      "sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \n",
      "correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \n",
      "supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \n",
      "aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \n",
      "all important interest groups they work with both parties); they \n",
      "immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \n",
      "competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \n",
      "rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \n",
      "Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \n",
      "the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \n",
      "like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \n",
      "companies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \n",
      "local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \n",
      "equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \n",
      "access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \n",
      "seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \n",
      "F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \n",
      "he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \n",
      "condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \n",
      "see-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \n",
      "into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \n",
      "technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \n",
      "boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \n",
      "and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \n",
      "of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \n",
      "former lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \n",
      "sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \n",
      "boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \n",
      "startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \n",
      "Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \n",
      "Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \n",
      "believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \n",
      "accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \n",
      "undiscriminating.)\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \n",
      "determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \n",
      "chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \n",
      "influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \n",
      "Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \n",
      "Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \n",
      "Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \n",
      "such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \n",
      "powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \n",
      "S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \n",
      "that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \n",
      "might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \n",
      "Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \n",
      "wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \n",
      "movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \n",
      "Furchtgott-Roth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \n",
      "before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \n",
      "gave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \n",
      "free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)—that \n",
      "began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n",
      "telecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n",
      "often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \n",
      "Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n",
      "beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \n",
      "deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's \n",
      "fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \n",
      "least, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \n",
      "chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \n",
      "part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \n",
      "of the Bush Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \n",
      "or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \n",
      "serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \n",
      "companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \n",
      "concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \n",
      "companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \n",
      "good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \n",
      "companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \n",
      "financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n",
      "industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \n",
      "wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n",
      "if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n",
      "duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n",
      "And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n",
      "poor health of the long-distance companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \n",
      "companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \n",
      "don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n",
      "fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part \n",
      "of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \n",
      "Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \n",
      "significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \n",
      "radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \n",
      "per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \n",
      "programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \n",
      "of Viacom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \n",
      "be hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \n",
      "rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \n",
      "to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \n",
      "disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \n",
      "forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle \n",
      "to get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \n",
      "homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An \n",
      "analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \n",
      "the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \n",
      "people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \n",
      "people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \n",
      "expectations and stirred too many passions.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \n",
      "conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \n",
      "F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \n",
      "signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \n",
      "the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has \n",
      "been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \n",
      "infuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \n",
      "the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \n",
      "F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's \n",
      "having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \n",
      "when he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \n",
      "divide\"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \n",
      "\"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and \n",
      "I can't afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \n",
      "Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \n",
      "tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \n",
      "somersault.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n",
      "1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \n",
      "Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \n",
      "the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \n",
      "else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \n",
      "looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \n",
      "Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \n",
      "fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \n",
      "walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \n",
      "jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \n",
      "of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \n",
      "became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \n",
      "the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \n",
      "the market before the fact—\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say—should \n",
      "wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \n",
      "litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \n",
      "then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \n",
      "of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's \n",
      "legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \n",
      "the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political \n",
      "skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \n",
      "Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \n",
      "also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of \n",
      "Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \n",
      "enduring love of law school—\"It's sort of like a law-school study \n",
      "session over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \n",
      "confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \n",
      "students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \n",
      "of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \n",
      "airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we'll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it's an \n",
      "automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \n",
      "the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and \n",
      "say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor \n",
      "puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law \n",
      "about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \n",
      "a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a \n",
      "similar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \n",
      "Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \n",
      "spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \n",
      "of ways that we're accustomed to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \n",
      "doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \n",
      "slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \n",
      "ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who \n",
      "enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \n",
      "about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \n",
      "sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \n",
      "thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \n",
      "Act had been excessive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can't fault those \n",
      "judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \n",
      "They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n",
      "But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, \n",

      "and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\n",

      "Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying\n",
      "businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman\n",
      "made their names during the recession of the early 1990's\n",
      "with investments in Continental and America West. The\n",

      "Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the\n",

      "Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making\n",

      "David does.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well\n",
      "established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion\n",
      "from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To\n",
      "celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San\n",
      "Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a\n",
      "party. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific\n",
      "hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no\n",
      "deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate\n",
      "blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but\n",
      "stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the\n",
      "businesses untenable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\n",
      "investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during\n",
      "that stretch. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"They started to cash out early in the cycle,\" said Mario\n",
      "Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money\n",
      "management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\n",
      "investors. \n",
      "\n",
      "The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas\n",
      "Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\n",
      "needed its help. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\n",
      "rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health\n",
      "maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\n",
      "mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new\n",
      "managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a\n",
      "$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian\n",
      "motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than\n",
      "quadrupled. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at\n",
      "the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million\n",
      "investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for\n",
      "which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,\n",
      "has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of\n",
      "Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand\n",
      "for luxury goods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a\n",
      "semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,\n",
      "both of which filed for bankruptcy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's\n",
      "performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\n",
      "two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The\n",
      "first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\n",
      "including investments made through March 1997, should\n",
      "return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific\n",
      "investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997\n",
      "- could return less than half that, this investor\n",
      "estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on\n",
      "these investments before the stock market sank. \n",
      "\n",
      "But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\n",
      "in the second fund, profits on these investments could\n",
      "rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new\n",
      "management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the\n",
      "economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, \"their\n",
      "returns look pretty good when you consider that some other\n",
      "funds won't return any capital\" to investors. \n",
      "\n",
      "But with the weak economy throwing many companies into\n",
      "trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\n",
      "success, the investor said. \"They should do exceptionally\n",
      "well,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It\n",
      "relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure\n",
      "troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except\n",
      "for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it\n",
      "replaces managers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,\n",
      "for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his\n",
      "old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it\n",
      "to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. \n",
      "\n",
      "Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then\n",
      "brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and\n",
      "in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief\n",
      "executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul\n",
      "of the company and is now considered a great turnaround\n",
      "artist of the industry. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob\n",
      "Ferguson,\" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for\n",
      "the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the\n",
      "thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982\n",

      "friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\n",
      "better job.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more\n",
      "extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was\n",
      "led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. \n",
      "\n",
      "W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.\n",
      "Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\n",
      "chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.\n",
      "Parker said the two men quickly realized they had \"somewhat\n",
      "kindred spirits.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The board replaced most senior managers at America West,\n",
      "except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped\n",
      "down last September. His restructuring plan had made the\n",
      "airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\n",
      "bankruptcy in August 1994. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth\n",
      "about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and\n",
      "the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. \n",
      "\n",

      "After overseeing managers who worked successfully with\n",

      "good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways\n",
      "was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris\n",

      "Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would \"be as labor\n",

      "interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with\n",
      "Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two\n",

      "EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer\n",

      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\n",
      "sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\n",
      "Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's\n",
      "push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\n",
      "and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\n",
      "\n",
      "While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\n",
      "exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\n",
      "animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\n",
      "risk to humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\n",
      "exposure levels\" as well, the report said. \"The potential human health\n",
      "effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\n",
      "uncertainties are involved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\n",
      "world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\n",
      "significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\n",
      "emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\n",
      "administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\n",
      "would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\n",
      "separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\n",
      "the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\n",
      "the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\n",
      "the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\n",
      "meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\n",
      "although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\n",
      "is expected to produce pollution reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\n",
      "probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\n",
      "diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\n",
      "gauging pollution health concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, the report said, \"the exposure-response data are\n",
      "considered too uncertain\" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\n",
      "cancer risk to an individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, said the report, the \"totality of evidence from human, animal\n",
      "and other supporting studies\" suggests that diesel exhaust \"is likely to be\n",
      "carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\n",
      "environmental exposure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\n",
      "short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\n",
      "\"chronic respiratory hazard to humans\" contributing to increased asthma and\n",
      "other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\n",
      "as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\n",
      "to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\n",
      "diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\n",
      "expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\n",
      "sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\n",
      "environmental organization, said: \"To reduce the public's exposure to\n",
      "harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\n",
      "clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\n",
      "standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\n",
      "Forum, said the EPA's report \"focused on the past,\" whereas \"the future is\n",

      "cleaner than just a dozen years ago.\"\n",

      "So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*\n",
      "likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\n",
      "means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\n",
      "the music playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\n",
      "from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\n",
      "niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\n",
      "doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\n",
      "requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\n",
      "disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the\n",
      "button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever\n",
      "get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\n",
      "surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\n",
      "when the music doesn't play.\n",
      "\n",
      "For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\n",
      "within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\n",
      "button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't\n",
      "change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\n",
      "press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\n",
      "the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\n",
      "disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\n",
      "CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a\n",
      "problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\n",
      "that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\n",
      "wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but\n",
      "which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\n",
      "hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\n",
      "understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\n",
      "CD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\n",
      "a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the\n",
      "player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\n",
      "the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\n",
      "but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\n",
      "FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\n",
      "binary distinction of music/no music.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\n",
      "playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\n",
      "would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\n",
      "The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\n",
      "the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\n",
      "there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\n",
      "The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\n",
      "the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\n",
      "device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\n",
      "open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\n",

      "Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,\n",
      "scientific research has suggested that people who have\n",
      "strong friendships experience less stress, they recover\n",
      "more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\n",
      "longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\n",
      "to the common cold, studies show. \n",
      "\n",
      "But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\n",
      "insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\n",
      "much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\n",
      "attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\n",
      "Lerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\n",
      "Connection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\n",
      "envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\n",
      "rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\n",
      "is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\n",
      "is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Another book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\n",
      "sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\n",
      "advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\n",
      "\"There's this myth that friendships should last a\n",
      "lifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it's better that\n",
      "they end.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\n",
      "the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\n",
      "that they have only recently paid close attention to\n",
      "friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\n",
      "between siblings or parents and children - have been seen\n",
      "as more important. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\n",
      "to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\n",
      "children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\n",
      "bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\n",
      "Lerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\n",
      "best friend hits me.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\n",
      "University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\n",
      "like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\n",
      "role of friends in emotional and physical health. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for\n",
      "stability the way it was in the past, and because people\n",
      "are less likely to be living with or near extended family\n",
      "members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\n",
      "a way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\n",
      "Fehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship\n",
      "focused on its health benefits. \"Now we're starting to look\n",
      "at it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\n",
      "a professor of psychology at Florida International\n",
      "University in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\n",
      "negative characteristics.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\n",
      "measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\n",
      "So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\n",
      "figured out that it is a significant problem. The early\n",
      "research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\n",
      "friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\n",
      "drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\n",
      "pursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\n",
      "Enron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\n",
      "antisocial behavior.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\n",
      "split up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\n",
      "psychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\n",
      "often in cases where one has shared personal information or\n",
      "secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\n",
      "suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It's\n",
      "more than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\n",
      "treatment is actually malicious.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's\n",
      "romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\n",
      "Lerner's patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\n",
      "there and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \n",
      "\n",
      "A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\n",
      "the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\n",
      "responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship\n",
      "described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\n",
      "\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\n",
      "that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\n",
      "people ever since, Dr. Yager said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\n",
      "but it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\n",
      "constantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They'll\n",
      "have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\n",
      "she finds out.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\n",
      "kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\n",
      "only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\n",
      "the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\n",
      "overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\n",
      "who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and\n",
      "the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\n",
      "from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but\n",
      "something always comes up at the last minute to someone who\n",
      "promises to be there for you when you need them, but then\n",
      "isn't,\" Dr. Yager said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\n",
      "when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\n",
      "to dislike the other one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\n",
      "discover there's something important they don't like about\n",
      "the other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\n",
      "\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\n",
      "person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\n",
      "it may take even more time for one person to meet the\n",
      "other's dislike criteria.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\n",
      "\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\n",
      "something go,\" she added. \"It's also an act of maturity\n",
      "sometimes to accept another person's limitations.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Acceptance should come easier among friends than among\n",
      "spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\n",
      "friend and do not need a full range of emotional support\n",
      "from each one. \n",
      "\n",
      "But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\n",
      "one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\n",
      "friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\n",
      "to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\n",
      "or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\n",
      "get together, ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\n",
      "but only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\n",
      "easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\n",
      "comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\n",
      "bad friendship should leave a person with more time and\n",
      "appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\n",
      "them in order while you're healthy and your life and work\n",
      "are going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\n",
      "when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\n",
      "health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\n",
      "course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\n",
      "life-preserving good friendship is.\"\n",

      "\"60 Minutes II\" Bush Interview:\n",
      "\n",
      "(CBS) No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of \n",
      "life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly \n",
      "200 years ago, has seen the nation’s capital city successfully attacked. \n",
      "But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first \n",
      "great crisis of the 21st century.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the president’s story of September 11th and the week America \n",
      "went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air \n",
      "Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, \n",
      "the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he \n",
      "remembers Sept. 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for \n",
      "some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,” Mr. Bush says \n",
      "during the Air Force One interview. “Not me. I made the pledge to myself \n",
      "and to people that I’m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So \n",
      "long as I’m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to \n",
      "justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley \n",
      "joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II \n",
      "wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first \n",
      "hours after the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane \n",
      "been so central to America in a crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. \n",
      "Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before \n",
      "6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad \n",
      "Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, \n",
      "hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the \n",
      "airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet \n",
      "engines echoed in Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it was an accident,” says Mr. Bush. “I thought it was a pilot \n",
      "error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a \n",
      "terrible mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a \n",
      "class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just \n",
      "after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was \n",
      "the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was \n",
      "a coordinated attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the \n",
      "news on his pager. The president’s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,” Card \n",
      "told the president\n",
      "\n",
      "When he said those words, what did he see in the President’s face?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,” Card recalls. “I \n",
      "think he understood that he was going to have to take command as \n",
      "commander-in-chief, not just as president.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What was going through Bush’s mind when he heard the news?\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we’re going to do \n",
      "something about it,” Mr. Bush recalls. “I realized I was in a unique \n",
      "setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was \n",
      "looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I \n",
      "can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to \n",
      "get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident \n",
      "that we were, you know, that the world had changed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called \n",
      "the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the \n",
      "attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first \n",
      "words to the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,” he said \n",
      "in the speech. “Today, we’ve had a national tragedy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn’t know that two more \n",
      "hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick \n",
      "Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent \n",
      "ran in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said to me, ‘Sir, we have to leave immediately’ and grabbed, put a \n",
      "hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the \n",
      "door of my office,” Cheney recalls. “I’m not sure how they do it, but \n",
      "they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There wasn’t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice \n",
      "president,” says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his \n",
      "command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First \n",
      "Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. “We knew there \n",
      "were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the \n",
      "Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this \n",
      "was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \n",
      "called Mr. Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get \n",
      "out of the West Wing,” says Rice. “They were hurrying me off the phone \n",
      "with the president and I just said, he said, ‘I’m coming back’ and we \n",
      "said ‘Mr. President that may not be wise.’ I remember stopping briefly \n",
      "to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, ‘I’m fine. You \n",
      "have to tell everybody that I’m fine’ but then settling into trying to \n",
      "deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I \n",
      "think the thing that was on everybody’s mind was how many more planes \n",
      "are coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret \n",
      "Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of \n",
      "succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become \n",
      "president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President \n",
      "Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says \n",
      "when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the \n",
      "White House, no matter what.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s important to emphasize it's not personal, you don’t think of it in \n",
      "personal terms, you’ve got a professional job to do,” says Cheney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers \n",
      "hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the \n",
      "capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Says Mineta: “Someone came in and said ‘Mr. Vice president there’s a \n",
      "plane 50 miles out,’ then he came in and said ‘Its now 10 miles out, we \n",
      "don’t know where it is exactly, but it’s coming in low and fast.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, \n",
      "the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush’s limousine sped toward Air Force One \n",
      "in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - \n",
      "was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in \n",
      "the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer \n",
      "Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled \n",
      "‘Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,’ and suddenly \n",
      "the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and \n",
      "the whole White House just flooded out,” she recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling \n",
      "a Secret Service agent “Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters \n",
      "protected.” At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, \n",
      "blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications \n",
      "Director Dan Bartlett was on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was like a rocket,” he remembers. “For a good ten minutes, the plane \n",
      "was going almost straight up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center \n",
      "Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche \n",
      "of steel, concrete and human lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Someone said to me, ‘Look at that’ I remember that, ‘Look at that’ and \n",
      "I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and \n",
      "the horror of that moment,” recalls Rice of the TV newscast.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also felt something in her gut: “That we’ve lost a lot of Americans \n",
      "and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of \n",
      "course I felt the anger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked \n",
      "planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether \n",
      "to shoot them down. “I discussed it with the president,” Cheney \n",
      "recalls. “‘Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these \n",
      "airliners that have been hijacked?’ He said yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was my advice. It was his decision,” says Cheney.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot \n",
      "down your own civilian aircraft,” says Bush. “But it was an easy \n",
      "decision to make given the – given the fact that we had learned that a \n",
      "commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it \n",
      "was, I didn’t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be \n",
      "done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They \n",
      "fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. \n",
      "The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of \n",
      "government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the \n",
      "White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us \n",
      "psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,” says \n",
      "Rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 \n",
      "minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of \n",
      "its twin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure \n",
      "location somewhere in Washington. “I was horrified,” she says. “I \n",
      "thought, ‘Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.’ It was a \n",
      "nightmare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By 10:30 a.m., America’s largest city was devastated, its military \n",
      "headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf \n",
      "Coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the \n",
      "consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining \n",
      "moment in the history of the United States,” says President Bush. “I \n",
      "didn’t need any legal briefs, I didn’t need any consultations, I knew we \n",
      "were at war.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the \n",
      "horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to \n",
      "Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, \n",
      "“This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says \n",
      "the president. \"Information was just flying from all directions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David \n",
      "had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush’s ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or \n",
      "that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of \n",
      "different information,” says Card.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the \n",
      "president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code \n",
      "name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, “Angel is next.” The \n",
      "threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get \n",
      "the president home,” Tillman says. “We actually have to consider \n",
      "everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to \n",
      "make sure that no one knows what our position is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret \n",
      "Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The \n",
      "crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from \n",
      "air traffic control – a suspect airliner was dead ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an \n",
      "airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,” Tillman \n",
      "remembers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal \n",
      "traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought \n",
      "that was a good idea, except the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such \n",
      "that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national \n",
      "security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,” says \n",
      "Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in \n",
      "Nebraska. Back in Washington, the president’s closest advisor, Karen \n",
      "Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. \n",
      "Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, \n",
      "sounded very shaken said, ‘Ma’am, I’m sorry, we can’t reach Air Force \n",
      "One.’” Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the \n",
      "attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn’t recognize.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in \n",
      "black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to \n",
      "see something like that in, in our nation's capital,” says Hughes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. “I knew it was \n",
      "a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, \n",
      "‘Hello?’ and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running \n",
      "through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to \n",
      "the location where I met the vice president.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most \n",
      "visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He \n",
      "didn’t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening \n",
      "to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the \n",
      "telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were \n",
      "heading,” says Tillman. “We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, \n",
      "'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly \n",
      "across the United States.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning \n",
      "each other to keep the route secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "“OK, where’s he going?” one tower radioed to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just watch him,” a second tower responded. “Don’t question him where’s \n",
      "he's going. Just work him and watch him, there’s no flight plan in and \n",
      "we’re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed \n",
      "back: “Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 o’clock position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside \n",
      "hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,” \n",
      "says Bartlett. “And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the \n",
      "pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the \n",
      "Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander \n",

      "\n",
      "We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, \n",
      "a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, \n",
      "with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He \n",
      "hadn’t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly \n",
      "worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, “The American \n",
      "people want to know where their dang president is.” The staff considered \n",
      "an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force \n",
      "One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At \n",
      "11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.\n",

      "“The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, \n",
      "we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,” Bush \n",
      "said to the nation from Barksdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington \n",
      "was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command \n",
      "center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications \n",
      "gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had \n",
      "a job for press secretary Fleischer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that \n",

      "\n",
      "Fleischer’s notes capture Mr. Bush’s language, plain and unguarded. To \n",
      "the vice president he said: “We’re at war, Dick, we’re going to find out \n",
      "who did this and kick their ass.” Another time, Mr. Bush said, “We’re \n",
      "not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The President adds, “I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I \n",
      "said, ‘We’re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you \n",

      "By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in \n",

      "gave no hint of what they would find below.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground \n",
      "Command Center. It was built to transmit a president’s order to go to \n",
      "nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching \n",
      "the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. \n",
      "After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference \n",
      "center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI \n",
      "and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls \n",
      "that Tenent answered: “Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. We’re doing the \n",
      "assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an \n",
      "essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence \n",
      "of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the \n",
      "seat numbers of the hijackers. “That was the first piece of hard \n",
      "evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in \n",
      "those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those \n",
      "individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and \n",
      "going through a process of elimination,” says Mueller.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the \n",
      "nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had \n",
      "enough. He decided to come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At one point, he said he didn’t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him \n",
      "out of Washington,” Fleischer says. “That verbatim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: \n",
      "“I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that \n",
      "you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists \n",
      "like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The \n",
      "other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition \n",
      "of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America \n",
      "collapsed, one of the nation’s worst days wore into evening. At the \n",
      "World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in \n",
      "Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.\n",

      "“Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would \n",
      "take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,” \n",
      "Bush said recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in \n",
      "Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the \n",
      "way to the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White \n",
      "House to return to? “I don’t remember thinking about whether or not the \n",
      "White House would have been obliterated,\" he recalls. \"I think I might \n",
      "have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to \n",
      "take our best shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. \n",
      "His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff \n",
      "were already working on the speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was \n",
      "reassurance,” remembers Hughes. “We had to show resolve, we had to \n",
      "reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become \n",
      "known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those \n",
      "who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. \n",
      "Bush didn’t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and \n",
      "he was emphatic about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first \n",
      "heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty \n",
      "million Americans were watching.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under \n",
      "attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,” he said \n",
      "from the Oval Office that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American \n",
      "history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House \n",
      "residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White \n",
      "House daily log: “The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. \n",
      "We think it's Osama bin Laden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No \n",
      "one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the \n",
      "president would do. In office for just eight months, he’d never been \n",
      "tested as commander-in-chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never asked them what they thought,” President Bush said of the \n",
      "Pentagon brass, “because I didn’t really – because I knew what I was \n",
      "gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set \n",
      "a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and \n",
      "bring them to justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: “The \n",
      "deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against \n",
      "our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,” he \n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor \n",
      "Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to \n",
      "strike bin Laden’s organization well before Sept. 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The president said, ‘You know I’m tired of swatting at flies, I need a \n",
      "strategy to eliminate these guys,’” Rice recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn’t \n",
      "pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without \n",
      "a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for \n",
      "came too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for \n",
      "was “literally headed to the president’s desk, I think, on the eleventh, \n",
      "tenth or eleventh, of September.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - \n",
      "who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who \n",
      "worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate \n",
      "cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in \n",
      "the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there’s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,” Mr. \n",

      "they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense \n",
      "(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what \n",
      "we called ‘boots on the ground.’ That if you’re gonna go to war, then \n",
      "you’ve gotta go to war with all your assets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president says he wanted to “fight and win a guerilla war with \n",
      "conventional means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director \n",
      "George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and \n",
      "intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the \n",
      "Taliban government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already \n",
      "developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an \n",
      "unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I like to describe it to my friends,” Powell says, “we had on the \n",
      "ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some \n",
      "CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the \n",
      "best in the world. How do you connect it all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day \n",
      "before, he had called the Pentagon the “mightiest building in the \n",
      "world.” Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American \n",
      "Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush \n",
      "left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering \n",
      "the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.\n",
      "The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the \n",
      "public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but \n",
      "this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. \n",
      "The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wasn’t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,” remembers \n",
      "Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. “And he ordered a \n",
      "hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening \n",
      "and that’s what he did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the \n",
      "president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet \n",
      "meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,” \n",
      "says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have \n",
      "trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service \n",
      "later that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I just scribbled a little note to him,” Powell recalls, “and I \n",
      "said, ‘Mr. President, I’ve learned over the years when you are going to \n",
      "give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will \n",
      "cause you to start to tear up.’ He looked at me and he smiled and then \n",
      "at the next break in the conversation he said, ‘The Secretary of State \n",
      "told me not to break down at the memorial service,’ and that broke the \n",
      "tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and \n",
      "she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. “I wanted \n",
      "the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think \n",
      "we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It also stirred the mourners’ resolve, as Rice remember. “As we stood to \n",
      "sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,” she says, “you could feel the \n",
      "entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind \n",
      "of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had \n",
      "been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what \n",
      "had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually \n",
      "going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for \n",
      "what he encountered there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t brief me, you couldn’t brief anybody on ground zero until \n",
      "you saw it,\" Mr. Bush says. “It was like – it was ghostly. Like you’re \n",
      "having a bad dream and you’re walking through the dream.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men \n",
      "and women at ground zero began to chant, “USA! USA!.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a lot of bloodlust,” the president recalls. “People were, you \n",
      "know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, ‘Don’t you ever forget \n",
      "this, Mr. President. Don’t let us down.’ The scene was very powerful. \n",
      "Very powerful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, “We can’t hear \n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president responded, “I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of \n",
      "the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down \n",
      "will hear all of us soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he’d posed with \n",
      "the firemen who always stood by whenever the president’s helicopter \n",
      "landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the \n",
      "picture were dead – lost at ground zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the \n",
      "faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished \n",
      "in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just \n",
      "missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several \n",
      "hundred of these families in a convention hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People said to me, ‘He’ll come out. Don’t worry, Mr. president, we’ll \n",
      "see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - he’ll find a place to \n",
      "survive underneath the rubble and we’ll get him out.’ I, on the other \n",
      "hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and \n",
      "cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, ‘This is incredibly sad \n",
      "because the loved ones won’t come out.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his \n",
      "firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the \n",
      "boy, “Your daddy won’t believe that I was here, so you show him that \n",
      "autograph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an effort “to provide a little hope,” the president recalls. “I \n",
      "still get emotional thinking about it because we’re dealing with people \n",
      "who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their…wives who loved \n",
      "their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for \n",
      "all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at \n",
      "times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I \n",
      "still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my \n",
      "tears, I see opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; \n",
      "he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. \n",
      "The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground \n",
      "zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I called the police department,” Howard remembers, “ and they said he \n",
      "hadn’t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, \n",
      "‘No, I don’t need to call back.’ If he hadn’t called in, I knew where he \n",
      "was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 \n",
      "when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, \n",
      "and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn’t stay away. The police \n",
      "department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,” Howard recalls. “And \n",
      "he extends his sympathy to me and that’s when I asked him I’d like to \n",
      "present George’s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who \n",
      "were killed over there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.\n",
      "\n",

      "“My message is for everybody who wears the uniform – get ready. The \n",
      "United States will do what it takes,” Mr. Bush told them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Powell remembers it, “He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was \n",
      "listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he \n",
      "wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. “On the \n",

      "\n",
      "When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the \n",
      "cabinet what he was planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wanted to just think it through,” Mr. Bush remembers. “Any time you \n",
      "commit troops to harm’s way, a president must make sure that he fully \n",
      "understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just \n",

However, I watch the Frontline show \"Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero\" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.\n",

      "  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\n",

      "  copies of constantly changing documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and \n",
      "totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of \n",
      "freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, \n",
      "democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only \n",
      "nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and \n",
      "guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the \n",
      "potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People \n",
      "everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; \n",
      "worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own \n",
      "property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom \n",
      "are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of \n",
      "protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of \n",
      "freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military \n",
      "strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our \n",
      "heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for \n",
      "unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that \n",
      "favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies \n",
      "can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and \n",
      "economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the \n",
      "world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace \n",
      "against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace \n",
      "by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the \n",
      "peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental \n",
      "commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed \n",
      "dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great \n",
      "industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of \n",
      "individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less \n",
      "than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to \n",
      "penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies \n",
      "against us.\n",
      "\n",
      "To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- \n",
      "from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and \n",
      "cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global \n",
      "reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help \n",
      "nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will \n",
      "hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the \n",
      "allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and \n",
      "countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop \n",
      "new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every \n",
      "turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism \n",
      "and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking \n",
      "weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing \n",
      "so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to \n",
      "succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other \n",
      "means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, \n",
      "contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous \n",
      "technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America \n",
      "will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We \n",
      "cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must \n",
      "be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence \n",
      "and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who \n",
      "saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have \n",
      "entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic \n",
      "opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community \n",
      "has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the \n",
      "seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace \n",
      "instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers \n",
      "find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist \n",
      "violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common \n",
      "interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by \n",
      "common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching \n",
      "for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese \n",
      "leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of \n",
      "national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political \n",
      "freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage \n",
      "the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, \n",
      "because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and \n",
      "international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great \n",
      "powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, \n",
      "trade, and cultural advancement.\n",
      "\n",

      "the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring \n",
      "the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to \n",
      "every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us \n",
      "that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our \n",
      "national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people \n",
      "into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and \n",
      "corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and \n",
      "drug cartels within their borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a \n",
      "better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free \n",
      "trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies \n",
      "out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual \n",
      "nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to \n",
      "build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. \n",

      "continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of \n",
      "AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is \n",
      "guided by the conviction that all nations have important \n",
      "responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. \n",
      "Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the \n",
      "spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international \n",
      "aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For \n",
      "freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, \n",
      "better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply \n",
      "the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed \n",
      "to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade \n",
      "Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as \n",
      "other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment \n",
      "these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations \n",

      "> Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security\n",
      "> strategy. The document, entitled \"The National Security Strategy of the\n",
      "> United States,\" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of\n",
      "> the Administration's policy.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> INTRODUCTION\n",
      ">\n",
      "> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n",
      "> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of\n",
      "> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n",
      "> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n",
      "> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n",
      "> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n",
      "> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n",
      "> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n",
      "> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n",
      "> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n",
      "> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\n",
      "> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n",
      "> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n",
      "> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n",
      "> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n",
      "> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n",
      "> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n",
      "> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n",
      "> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n",
      "> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n",
      "> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n",
      "> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n",
      "> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n",
      "> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n",
      "> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n",
      "> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n",
      "> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n",
      "> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n",
      "> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n",
      "> against us.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n",
      "> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n",
      "> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n",
      "> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n",
      "> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n",
      "> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n",
      "> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n",
      "> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n",
      "> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n",
      "> turn.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n",
      "> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n",
      "> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n",
      "> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n",
      "> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n",
      "> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\n",
      "> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous\n",
      "> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\n",
      "> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n",
      "> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n",
      "> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence\n",
      "> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\n",
      "> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\n",
      "> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\n",
      "> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\n",
      "> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\n",
      "> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\n",
      "> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers\n",
      "> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\n",
      "> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\n",
      "> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\n",
      "> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\n",
      "> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\n",
      "> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\n",
      "> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\n",
      "> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\n",
      "> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\n",
      "> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\n",
      "> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\n",
      "> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\n",
      "> trade, and cultural advancement.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\n",
      "> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\n",
      "> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\n",
      "> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\n",
      "> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\n",
      "> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\n",
      "> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\n",
      "> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\n",
      "> drug cartels within their borders.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\n",
      "> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\n",
      "> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\n",
      "> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\n",
      "> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\n",
      "> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\n",
      "> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\n",
      "> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\n",
      "> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\n",
      "> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\n",
      "> AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\n",
      "> guided by the conviction that all nations have important\n",
      "> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\n",
      "> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\n",
      "> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\n",
      "> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\n",
      "> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\n",
      "> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\n",
      "> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\n",
      "> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\n",
      "> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\n",
      "> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\n",
      "> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\n",
      "> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\n",
      "> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\n",
      "> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\n",
      "> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\n",
      "> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\n",
      "> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\n",
      "> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all\n",
      "> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\n",
      "> this great mission.\n",

      ">\n",
      "> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great\n",
      "> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and\n",
      "> equality.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\n",
      "> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and\n",
      "> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we\n",
      "> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by\n",

      "> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to\n",
      "> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,\n",
      "> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a\n",
      "> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our\n",
      "> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help\n",
      "> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to\n",

      "> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation\n",
      "> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and\n",

      "> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\n",

      "> that these institutions do.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n",
      "> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\n",
      "> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n",
      "> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n",
      "> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n",
      "> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\n",

      "> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\n",
      "> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\n",

      "> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\n",
      "> development projects that show results.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\n",
      "> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\n",
      "> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\n",
      "> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\n",
      "> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national\n",
      "> security strategy.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\n",

      "> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\n",
      "> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\n",

      "> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan\n",
      "> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n",
      "> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than\n",

      "> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\n",

      "> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States\n",
      "> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a \"public\" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GATHERING THE DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their \"brightness\" - varies according to temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a \"remarkable\" level of agreement between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by \"radiosonde\" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,\" Christy said. \"If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,\" Christy said. \"They are not representative of the total globe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GLOBAL COVERAGE\n",
      "\n",
      "One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. \"Radiosonde\" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\n",
      "\n",
      "While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard \"ships of opportunity.\" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU\n",
      "\n",
      "With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS\n",
      "\n",
      "Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local \"asphalt effect\" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY\n",
      "\n",
      "While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Rebuild at Ground Zero\n",
      "\n",
      "By LARRY SILVERSTEIN\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the\n",
      "horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who\n",
      "perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\n",
      "and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\n",
      "amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\n",
      "that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,\n",
      "indeed, for all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\n",
      "feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\n",
      "must be replaced on the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\n",
      "along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\n",
      "Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\n",
      "economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\n",
      "of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\n",
      "have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\n",
      "York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\n",
      "may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\n",
      "vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,\n",
      "and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\n",
      "made a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\n",
      "symbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\n",
      "destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\n",
      "with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\n",
      "sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\n",
      "all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\n",
      "feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\n",
      "simply never rebuilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\n",
      "recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\n",
      "the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\n",
      "office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\n",
      "That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\n",
      "before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\n",
      "remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\n",
      "and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\n",
      "planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n",
      "\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\n",
      "even more the logical locus of office development.\n",
      "\n",
      "And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\n",
      "force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\n",
      "Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\n",
      "million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\n",
      "anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\n",
      "heightens the need.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\n",
      "cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\n",
      "history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\n",
      "office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\n",
      "up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\n",
      "beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\n",
      "at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\n",
      "over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\n",
      "line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\n",
      "annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'\n",
      "rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\n",
      "previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\n",
      "extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\n",
      "will most New Yorkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\n",
      "that the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\n",
      "future.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\n",
      "and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\n",
      "significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\n",
      "happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\n",
      "residents of the area.\n",

      "essential ideas of \"shaping,\" rather than reacting to, the rest of the\n",

      "the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which\n",
      "the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major\n",

      "Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush\n",

      "aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in\n",
      "direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,\n",
      "especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress\n",
      "since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which\n",
      "his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of\n",

      "Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been \"a\n",

      "not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials\n",

      "DataPower delivers XML acceleration device\n",
      "By Scott Tyler Shafer\n",
      "August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n",
      "\n",
      "DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \n",
      "specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \n",
      "process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \n",
      "hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \n",
      "according to company officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \n",
      "family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",
      "controls the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \n",
      "Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \n",
      "May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \n",

      "> \n",
      "> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",

      "> \n",
      "> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \n",

      "> will be mostly false.\n",
      "> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",

      "> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \n",
      "> 1,400 bytes \n",
      "> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \n",
      "> collection of \n",
      "> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \n",

      "DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \n",
      "specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \n",
      "process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \n",
      "hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \n",
      "according to company officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\n",
      "\n",
      "family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\n",
      "\n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\n",
      "\n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\n",
      "\n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\n",
      "\n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\n",
      "\n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\n",
      "\n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",
      "controls the device.\n",

      "> head of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. \n",
      "> Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \n",
      "> one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \n",
      "> F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \n",
      "> arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an \n",
      "> \"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \n",
      "> predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \n",
      "> to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \n",
      "> calls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \n",
      "> a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \n",
      "> cautious. \"It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,\" \n",
      "> another former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \n",
      "> answer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \n",
      "> subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \n",
      "> subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \n",
      "> him. \"You don't care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don't \n",
      "> care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the \n",
      "> fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over \n",
      "> there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \n",
      "> seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive \n",
      "> vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \n",
      "> regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your job?\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats \n",
      "> and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \n",
      "> of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \n",
      "> created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \n",
      "> New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \n",
      "> cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \n",
      "> that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \n",
      "> other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \n",
      "> the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \n",
      "> unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \n",
      "> well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \n",
      "> supervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \n",
      "> among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by \n",
      "> artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \n",
      "> In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission \n",
      "> more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \n",
      "> of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \n",
      "> terrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank \n",
      "> president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \n",
      "> According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \n",
      "> blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \n",
      "> in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \n",
      "> anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \n",
      "> station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \n",
      "> because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \n",
      "> niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \n",
      "> breakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \n",
      "> commission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \n",
      "> self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n",
      "> ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n",
      "> long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \n",
      "> which customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \n",
      "> company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \n",
      "> mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n",
      "> phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n",
      "> to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \n",
      "> everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \n",
      "> millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \n",
      "> telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \n",
      "> monopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \n",
      "> control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \n",
      "> the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \n",
      "> and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \n",
      "> consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \n",
      "> prosperous, too.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n",
      "> one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \n",
      "> most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \n",
      "> Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \n",
      "> modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \n",
      "> bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \n",
      "> as \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \n",
      "> of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \n",
      "> offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \n",
      "> companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \n",
      "> customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \n",
      "> get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \n",
      "> competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \n",
      "> economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \n",
      "> Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \n",
      "> helping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \n",
      "> brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \n",
      "> jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \n",
      "> beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \n",
      "> slogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \n",
      "> the twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \n",
      "> sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \n",
      "> correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \n",
      "> supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \n",
      "> aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \n",
      "> all important interest groups they work with both parties); they \n",
      "> immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \n",
      "> competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \n",
      "> rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \n",
      "> Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \n",
      "> the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \n",
      "> like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \n",
      "> companies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \n",
      "> local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \n",
      "> equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \n",
      "> access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \n",
      "> seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \n",
      "> F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \n",
      "> he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \n",
      "> condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \n",
      "> see-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \n",
      "> into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \n",
      "> technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \n",
      "> boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \n",
      "> and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \n",
      "> of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \n",
      "> former lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \n",
      "> sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \n",
      "> boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \n",
      "> startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \n",
      "> Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \n",
      "> Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \n",
      "> believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \n",
      "> accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)\n",
      "> \n",
      "> By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \n",
      "> determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \n",
      "> chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \n",
      "> influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \n",
      "> Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \n",
      "> Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \n",
      "> Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \n",
      "> such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \n",
      "> powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \n",
      "> S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \n",
      "> that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \n",
      "> might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \n",
      "> Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \n",
      "> wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \n",
      "> movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \n",
      "> Furchtgott-Roth.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \n",
      "> before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \n",
      "> gave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \n",
      "> free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)—that \n",
      "> began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n",
      "> telecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n",
      "> often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \n",
      "> Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n",
      "> beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \n",
      "> deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's \n",
      "> fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \n",
      "> least, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \n",
      "> chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \n",
      "> part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \n",
      "> of the Bush Administration.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \n",
      "> or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \n",
      "> serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \n",
      "> companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \n",
      "> concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \n",
      "> companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \n",
      "> good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \n",
      "> companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \n",
      "> financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n",
      "> industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \n",
      "> wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n",
      "> if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n",
      "> duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n",
      "> And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n",
      "> poor health of the long-distance companies.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \n",
      "> companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \n",
      "> don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n",
      "> fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part \n",
      "> of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \n",
      "> Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \n",
      "> significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \n",
      "> radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \n",
      "> per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \n",
      "> programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \n",
      "> of Viacom.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \n",
      "> be hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \n",
      "> rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \n",
      "> to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \n",
      "> disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \n",
      "> forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle \n",
      "> to get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \n",
      "> homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An \n",
      "> analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \n",
      "> the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \n",
      "> people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \n",
      "> people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \n",
      "> expectations and stirred too many passions.)\n",
      "> \n",
      "> But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \n",
      "> conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \n",
      "> F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \n",
      "> signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \n",
      "> the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has \n",
      "> been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \n",
      "> infuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \n",
      "> the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \n",
      "> F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's \n",
      "> having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \n",
      "> when he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \n",
      "> divide\"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \n",
      "> \"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and \n",
      "> I can't afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \n",
      "> Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \n",
      "> tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \n",
      "> somersault.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n",
      "> 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \n",
      "> Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \n",
      "> the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \n",
      "> else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \n",
      "> looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \n",
      "> Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \n",
      "> fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \n",
      "> walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \n",
      "> jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \n",
      "> of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \n",
      "> became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \n",
      "> the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \n",
      "> the market before the fact—\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say—should \n",
      "> wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \n",
      "> litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \n",
      "> then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \n",
      "> of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's \n",
      "> legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \n",
      "> the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political \n",
      "> skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \n",
      "> Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \n",
      "> also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of \n",
      "> Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \n",
      "> enduring love of law school—\"It's sort of like a law-school study \n",
      "> session over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \n",
      "> confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \n",
      "> students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \n",
      "> of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \n",
      "> airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"I think we'll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it's an \n",
      "> automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \n",
      "> the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and \n",
      "> say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor \n",
      "> puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law \n",
      "> about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \n",
      "> a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a \n",
      "> similar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \n",
      "> Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \n",
      "> spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \n",
      "> of ways that we're accustomed to.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \n",
      "> doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \n",
      "> slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \n",
      "> ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who \n",
      "> enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \n",
      "> about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \n",
      "> sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \n",
      "> thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \n",
      "> Act had been excessive.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can't fault those \n",
      "> judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \n",
      "> They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n",
      "> But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, \n",
      "> anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close \n",
      "> to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \n",
      "> on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I \n",
      "> don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \n",
      "> or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \n",
      "> were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \n",
      "> reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \n",
      "> But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \n",
      "> excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \n",
      "> certainly was.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \n",
      "> expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \n",
      "> economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \n",
      "> exaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by \n",
      "> politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \n",
      "> gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \n",
      "> that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \n",
      "> see numbers go up on the board.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \n",
      "> 'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \n",
      "> thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \n",
      "> Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' \" Now Powell returned \n",
      "> to being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \n",
      "> unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're \n",
      "> there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \n",
      "> the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no \n",
      "> question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \n",
      "> debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \n",
      "> chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \n",
      "> slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \n",
      "> Powell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \n",
      "> opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're \n",
      "> in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \n",
      "> debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \n",
      "> ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \n",

      "> those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, \n",
      "> companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \n",

      "> it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \n",
      "> demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \n",
      "> gestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \n",
      "> F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \n",
      "> appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \n",
      "> communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \n",
      "> out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \n",
      "> and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \n",
      "> up the telecom industry.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \n",
      "> company provided cable television and only one provided local phone \n",
      "> service. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there's one of each of \n",
      "> those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one \n",
      "> of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \n",
      "> capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other.\" \n",
      "> Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \n",
      "> provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \n",
      "> provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n",
      "> \"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \n",
      "> is, Does it stay that way?\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \n",
      "> information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \n",
      "> people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \n",
      "> which distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it's easy. If you \n",
      "> were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we \n",
      "> know how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \n",
      "> market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \n",
      "> other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \n",
      "> the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption \n",
      "> there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \n",
      "> viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I \n",
      "> think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility \n",
      "> that's ascribed to it sometimes.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \n",
      "> parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \n",
      "> same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \n",
      "> exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \n",
      "> the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \n",
      "> and then we have policies like\"—here his tone went from ironic to \n",
      "> sarcastic—\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \n",
      "> of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \n",
      "> and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \n",
      "> fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \n",
      "> can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \n",
      "> he regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \n",
      "> market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying \n",
      "> water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \n",
      "> planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \n",
      "> Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything \n",
      "> at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's \n",
      "> waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \n",
      "> so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the \n",
      "> crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \n",
      "> networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \n",
      "> Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never \n",
      "> commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \n",
      "> and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \n",
      "> says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \n",
      "> irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what \n",
      "> has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.—much \n",
      "> more than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore \n",
      "> Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \n",
      "> Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \n",
      "> there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \n",
      "> arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \n",
      "> have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that \n",
